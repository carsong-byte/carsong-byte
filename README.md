# Hi, I’m Carson 👋

## 📊 About Me
I’m a Business Economics graduate with a strong interest in data-driven decision-making, financial analysis, and compliance-focused problem solving. I enjoy working at the intersection of business, analytics, and real-world systems — turning complex information into clear insights.

I recently graduated **magna cum laude** from **Pace University**, where I completed my degree early and conducted applied research in consumer behavior and policy analysis.
